# Photogate Box
The photogate Box is an interface box intended to act as an interface between a photogate and a computer. 
The Photogate box includes a microcontroller with built-in hardware timers.

## Prototype project from 2006. 

> Some changes have been made that were not included in the notes at the link given below. Details
will be added to this README.md file to reflect the photogate timer box as is currently used.

## PIC Wiring

![image of 2014 prototype](http://www3.telus.net/danpeirce/notes/photogate-box/board_test01.jpg)

The PIC inputs and outputs as defined in the source code

```c
// Configure 2-Way Status LED

  TRISCbits.TRISC3 = 0;     // set as output 
  TRISCbits.TRISC4 = 0;     // and as output
```
  
```c
  // Configure USART module

  TRISCbits.TRISC6 = 0;     // set TX (RC6) as output 
  TRISCbits.TRISC7 = 1;     // and RX (RC7) as input
```

```c
  // Configure RC2/CCP1 and RB3/CCP2 as inputs
  // Photogate 1 is on RC2/CCP1/Pin 17 and 
  // Photogate 2 is on RB3/CCP2/Pin 36 
  TRISCbits.TRISC2 = 1;     // set RC2(CCP1) as input
  TRISBbits.TRISB3 = 1;     // set RB3(CCP2) as input 
```
