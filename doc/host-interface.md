# Host Interface Options

## Labview

At KPU our first year physics labs make use of Labview from National Instruments as the host platform.

## Python

Since Python is open source and available to the general public for free it is a sensible alternative 
for use with common operating systems. At KPU we have not used python in the past for this purpose so 
I would like to explore the possibilities. IPython and the QTConsole are perhaps a good place to start.
For Windows computers Anaconda will install most of the necessary packages.
